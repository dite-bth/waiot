+ **Building the Web of Things**
av Dominique Guinard, Vlad Trifa - http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/building-the-web-of-things-9781617292682
    + The Internet of Things (IoT) is a hot topic Analysts call it a disruptive technology. Competing standards and technologies pop up daily, and there are no tangible signs of a single protocol that will let all devices, services, and applications communicate seamlessly. Fortunately, there's a great universal IoT application platform available now: the World Wide Web. Web standards and tools provide the ideal substrate for connected devices and applications to exchange data. This vision is called the Web of Things. "Building the Web of Things" is a hands-on guide for designing and implementing scalable, flexible, and open IoT solutions using Web technologies. This book provides the right balance of theory, code samples, and practical examples, and shows how to connect all sorts of devices to the Web and expose their services and data over REST APIs. After building a simple proof of concept app, readers will learn a systematic methodology and system architecture for connecting things to the Web, finding other things, sharing data, and combining these components to rapidly build distributed applications and physical mashups. With each chapter, readers gain the knowledge and skills needed to take full advantage of a new generation of real-time, web-connected devices and services, giving them the ability to build scalable applications that merge the physical and digital worlds.

Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.
    
+ **Iot Fundamentals: Networking Technologies, Protocols, and Use Cases for the Internet of Things**
av David Hanes, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Patrick Grossetete - http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/iot-fundamentals-networking-technologies-protocols-and-use-cases-for-the-internet-of-things-9781587144561
    + The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly coming of age. Billions of devices are already Internet-connected. Standards and protocols are stabilizing. Increasingly, network professionals are being called upon to integrate real IoT devices and applications, and solve real problems with IoT technologies. IoT Fundamentals: Networking Technologies, Protocols, and Use Cases for the Internet of Things gives them the first comprehensive practical reference for making IoT work. Four leading Cisco IoT experts have brought together information and insights that were previously available only in white papers, standards documents, and other hard-to-find sources - or nowhere at all. They've organized IoT in an easy-to-follow manner, distilling its basic components, and showing how IoT concepts, protocols, and technologies translate into real-world applications. Part I offers in-depth coverage of the fundamental elements of the IoT technology space, including relevant communication and signaling protocols, devices, overall IoT architecture, and foundational design and deployment concepts. Building on these concepts, the authors offer in-depth drilldowns on key IoT components, including sensors, connectivity, data, and applications. In Part II, IoT Fundamentals applies these fundamental elements to real world use cases in many key vertical markets, including home automation, energy production, power grid intelligence, factory efficiency, city governance, sports/entertainment, and several more. Readers won't just gain deep insight both into the remarkable power of IoT applications: they will discover exactly what it takes to deliver these applications in real network and business environments."

+ **The Internet of Things av Samuel Greengard** - http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/the-internet-of-things-9780262527736
    + We turn on the lights in our house from a desk in an office miles away. Our refrigerator alerts us to buy milk on the way home. A package of cookies on the supermarket shelf suggests that we buy it, based on past purchases. The cookies themselves are on the shelf because of a "smart" supply chain. When we get home, the thermostat has already adjusted the temperature so that it's toasty or bracing, whichever we prefer. This is the Internet of Things -- a networked world of connected devices, objects, and people. In this book, Samuel Greengard offers a guided tour through this emerging world and how it will change the way we live and work. Greengard explains that the Internet of Things (IoT) is still in its early stages. Smart phones, cloud computing, RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology, sensors, and miniaturization are converging to make possible a new generation of embedded and immersive technology. Greengard traces the origins of the IoT from the early days of personal computers and the Internet and examines how it creates the conceptual and practical framework for a connected world.He explores the industrial Internet and machine-to-machine communication, the basis for smart manufacturing and end-to-end supply chain visibility; the growing array of smart consumer devices and services -- from Fitbit fitness wristbands to mobile apps for banking; the practical and technical challenges of building the IoT; and the risks of a connected world, including a widening digital divide and threats to privacy and security. Finally, he considers the long-term impact of the IoT on society, narrating an eye-opening "Day in the Life" of IoT connections circa 2025.

    + The Silent Intelligence is a book about the Internet of Things. We talk about the history, trends, technology ecosystem and future of Connected Cities, Connected Homes, Connected Health and Connected Cars. We also discuss the most exciting growth areas for entrepreneurs and venture capital investors. We share exciting stories and unique opinions of more than 30 industry veterans, experts and visionaries from Google, Ericsson, AT&T, Qualcomm, SAP, MIT, Jawbone and many others. We called this book The Silent Intelligence because most of the activity and growth in the space so far has been outside of mainstream visibility. Our aim is to help executives, entrepreneurs, investors and everybody who is interested in this topic, better understand the opportunities and challenges of the Internet of Things. We also hope that the new growth opportunities discussed in this book will be as exciting to you as they are to us.

+ **Internet of Things: A Hands-On Approach** - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Internet-Things-A-Hands-On-Approach/dp/0996025510/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1JQK6XXEDXWEBXDH80RE
    + Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical and virtual objects that have unique identities and are connected to the internet to facilitate intelligent applications that make energy, logistics, industrial control, retail, agriculture and many other domains "smarter". Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet that is rapidly gathering momentum driven by the advancements in sensor networks, mobile devices, wireless communications, networking and cloud technologies. Experts forecast that by the year 2020 there will be a total of 50 billion devices/things connected to the internet. 

This book is written as a textbook on Internet of Things for educational programs at colleges and universities, and also for IoT vendors and service providers who may be interested in offering a broader perspective of Internet of Things to accompany their own customer and developer training programs. The typical reader is expected to have completed a couple of courses in programming using traditional high-level languages at the college-level, and is either a senior or a beginning graduate student in one of the science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) fields. Like our companion book on Cloud Computing, we have tried to write a comprehensive book that transfers knowledge through an immersive "hands on" approach, where the reader is provided the necessary guidance and knowledge to develop working code for real-world IoT applications.

Organization
The book is organized into 3 main parts, comprising of a total of 11 chapters. Part I covers the building blocks of Internet of Things (IoTs) and their characteristics. A taxonomy of IoT systems is proposed comprising of various IoT levels with increasing levels of complexity. Domain specific Internet of Things and their real-world applications are described. A generic design methodology for IoT is proposed. An IoT system management approach using NETCONF-YANG is described. Part II introduces the reader to the programming aspects of Internet of Things with a view towards rapid prototyping of complex IoT applications. We chose Python as the primary programming language for this book, and an introduction to Python is also included within the text to bring readers to a common level of expertise. We describe packages, frameworks and cloud services including the WAMP-AutoBahn, Xively cloud and Amazon Web Services which can be used for developing IoT systems. We chose the Raspberry Pi device for the examples in this book. Reference architectures for different levels of IoT applications are examined in detail. Case studies with complete source code for various IoT domains including home automation, smart environment, smart cities, logistics, retail, smart energy, smart agriculture, industrial control and smart health, are described. Part III introduces the reader to advanced topics on IoT including IoT data analytics and Tools for IoT. Case studies on collecting and analyzing data generated by Internet of Things in the cloud are described.

+ **Rethinking the Internet of Things: A Scalable Approach to Connecting Everything** - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rethinking-Internet-Things-Connecting-Everything-ebook/dp/B00EBCGHSW/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454583501&sr=1-8&keywords=internet+of+things
    + Apress is proud to announce that Rethinking the Internet of Things was a 2014 Jolt Award Finalist, the highest honor for a programming book. And the amazing part is that there is no code in the book.

Over the next decade, most devices connected to the Internet will not be used by people in the familiar way that personal computers, tablets and smart phones are. Billions of interconnected devices will be monitoring the environment, transportation systems, factories, farms, forests, utilities, soil and weather conditions, oceans and resources.

Many of these sensors and actuators will be networked into autonomous sets, with much of the information being exchanged machine-to-machine directly and without human involvement. Machine-to-machine communications are typically terse. Most sensors and actuators will report or act upon small pieces of information - "chirps". Burdening these devices with current network protocol stacks is inefficient, unnecessary and unduly increases their cost of ownership.

This must change. The architecture of the Internet of Things must evolve now by incorporating simpler protocols toward at the edges of the network, or remain forever inefficient. Rethinking the Internet of Things describes reasons why we must rethink current approaches to the Internet of Things. Appropriate architectures that will coexist with existing networking protocols are described in detail. An architecture comprised of integrator functions, propagator nodes, and end devices, along with their interactions, is explored.
