+ **Building the Web of Things
av Dominique Guinard, Vlad Trifa ** - http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/building-the-web-of-things-9781617292682
    + __The Internet of Things (IoT) is a hot topic Analysts call it a disruptive technology. Competing standards and technologies pop up daily, and there are no tangible signs of a single protocol that will let all devices, services, and applications communicate seamlessly. Fortunately, there's a great universal IoT application platform available now: the World Wide Web. Web standards and tools provide the ideal substrate for connected devices and applications to exchange data. This vision is called the Web of Things.

"Building the Web of Things" is a hands-on guide for designing and implementing scalable, flexible, and open IoT solutions using Web technologies. This book provides the right balance of theory, code samples, and practical examples, and shows how to connect all sorts of devices to the Web and expose their services and data over REST APIs. After building a simple proof of concept app, readers will learn a systematic methodology and system architecture for connecting things to the Web, finding other things, sharing data, and combining these components to rapidly build distributed applications and physical mashups. With each chapter, readers gain the knowledge and skills needed to take full advantage of a new generation of real-time, web-connected devices and services, giving them the ability to build scalable applications that merge the physical and digital worlds.

Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.__
    
+ **Iot Fundamentals: Networking Technologies, Protocols, and Use Cases for the Internet of Things**
av David Hanes, Gonzalo Salgueiro, Patrick Grossetete - http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/iot-fundamentals-networking-technologies-protocols-and-use-cases-for-the-internet-of-things-9781587144561
    + _The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly coming of age. Billions of devices are already Internet-connected. Standards and protocols are stabilizing. Increasingly, network professionals are being called upon to integrate real IoT devices and applications, and solve real problems with IoT technologies. IoT Fundamentals: Networking Technologies, Protocols, and Use Cases for the Internet of Things gives them the first comprehensive practical reference for making IoT work. Four leading Cisco IoT experts have brought together information and insights that were previously available only in white papers, standards documents, and other hard-to-find sources - or nowhere at all. They've organized IoT in an easy-to-follow manner, distilling its basic components, and showing how IoT concepts, protocols, and technologies translate into real-world applications. Part I offers in-depth coverage of the fundamental elements of the IoT technology space, including relevant communication and signaling protocols, devices, overall IoT architecture, and foundational design and deployment concepts. Building on these concepts, the authors offer in-depth drilldowns on key IoT components, including sensors, connectivity, data, and applications. In Part II, IoT Fundamentals applies these fundamental elements to real world use cases in many key vertical markets, including home automation, energy production, power grid intelligence, factory efficiency, city governance, sports/entertainment, and several more. Readers won't just gain deep insight both into the remarkable power of IoT applications: they will discover exactly what it takes to deliver these applications in real network and business environments."_

+ **The Internet of Things
av Samuel Greengard** - http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/the-internet-of-things-9780262527736
    + __We turn on the lights in our house from a desk in an office miles away. Our refrigerator alerts us to buy milk on the way home. A package of cookies on the supermarket shelf suggests that we buy it, based on past purchases. The cookies themselves are on the shelf because of a "smart" supply chain. When we get home, the thermostat has already adjusted the temperature so that it's toasty or bracing, whichever we prefer. This is the Internet of Things -- a networked world of connected devices, objects, and people. In this book, Samuel Greengard offers a guided tour through this emerging world and how it will change the way we live and work. Greengard explains that the Internet of Things (IoT) is still in its early stages. Smart phones, cloud computing, RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology, sensors, and miniaturization are converging to make possible a new generation of embedded and immersive technology. Greengard traces the origins of the IoT from the early days of personal computers and the Internet and examines how it creates the conceptual and practical framework for a connected world.He explores the industrial Internet and machine-to-machine communication, the basis for smart manufacturing and end-to-end supply chain visibility; the growing array of smart consumer devices and services -- from Fitbit fitness wristbands to mobile apps for banking; the practical and technical challenges of building the IoT; and the risks of a connected world, including a widening digital divide and threats to privacy and security. Finally, he considers the long-term impact of the IoT on society, narrating an eye-opening "Day in the Life" of IoT connections circa 2025.__
